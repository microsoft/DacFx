# DacFx and Related Components

The Microsoft SQL Server Data-Tier Application Framework (DacFx) is a .NET library which provides application lifecycle services for database development and management for Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Azure SQL Databases.

SqlPackage.exe is a command line interface to DacFx and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. For more about SqlPackage.exe, check out the [reference page on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage).

Microsoft.Build.Sql (preview) is a [.NET project SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview) for SQL projects, compiling T-SQL code to a data-tier application package (dacpac).  The SQL project SDK is available via NuGet ([https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Sql/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Sql/)) and in this [repository](/src/Microsoft.Build.Sql/README.md).
